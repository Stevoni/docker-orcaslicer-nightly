This is a LinuxServers.io based container for the OrcaSlicer release and nightly builds.

I use a similar format to the official LinuxServer.io container for [OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-orcaslicer).

All credit goes to the LinuxServer.io team.

The original files created by the linuxserver are suffixed with ".linuxserver" to avoid conflicts.
